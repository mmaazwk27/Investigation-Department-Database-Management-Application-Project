## 📌 Features

- 🧑‍⚖️ **Role-Based Access Control**
  - **Admins** have full CRUD access.
  - **Users** can view data and request operations with admin confirmation.

## 🧾 Entity Management

This application allows structured management of various investigation-related entities. The access and permitted operations depend on the user role:

| Entity            | Add         | View       | Edit                                          | Delete      |
|-------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Police Officers** | ✅ (Admin)  | ✅ (All)   | ✅ (Admin)                                     | ✅ (Admin)   |
| **Criminals**       | ✅ (Admin)  | ✅ (All)   | ✅ (Admin)<br>_Only status editable_          | ✅ (Admin)   |
| **Crimes**          | ✅ (Admin)  | ✅ (All)   | ❌                                            | ✅ (Admin)   |
| **Cases**           | ✅ (Admin)  | ✅ (All)   | ✅ (Admin)<br>_Only status editable_          | ✅ (Admin)   |
| **Evidence**        | ✅ (Admin)  | ✅ (All)   | ❌                                              | ✅ (Admin)   |
| **Victims**         | ✅ (Admin)  | ✅ (All)   | ❌                                              | ✅ (Admin)   |
| **Witnesses**       | ✅ (Admin)  | ✅ (All)   | ❌                                              | ✅ (Admin)   |
| **Users**           | ✅ (Admin)  | ✅ (Admin) | ✅ (Admin)<br>_Only role editable_            | ✅ (Admin)   |

🧑‍💼 **Admin Access**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for all entities.  
👤 **User Access**: View-only access to all entities.

> 🔒 Edit permissions are selectively restricted: only `criminal status`, `case status`, and `user roles` are editable via the UI. Other fields remain read-only after creation.

- 🧠 **Smart Dashboard**
  - Stylish UI with summary cards (counts, metrics, quick navigation).
  - Dynamic links to detailed views.

- 🔍 **Relational Insights**
  - Crimes auto-display related Evidence, Victims, and Witnesses via `crime_id`.
  - Recent entries sorted using `created_at` timestamps.

- 🧮 **Database Design**
  - Normalized schema with clear foreign key relationships.
  - SQL views are not yet implemented.  
> Planned future implementation will involve SQL views to offer optimized and secure read access for non-admin users.

```

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- 📜 Add login attempt logs & audit trails for better security and accountability  
- 🧾 PDF report generation for printable case summaries and records  
- 🗺️ Map-based visualization using **Leaflet.js** or **Google Maps API** for geo-tagged crime data
